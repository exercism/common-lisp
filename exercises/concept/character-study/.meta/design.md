# Design

## Learning objectives

- Know how character literals can be written using the `#\c` syntax
- Be aware of the special `#\Space` and `#\Newline` characters
- Be able to apply simple predicates like `alphanumericp`,
  `digit-char-p`, `upper-case-p`, etc
- Know how to compare characters in a case-sensitive manner using
  `char>`, `char=`, etc

## Out of scope

- Strings
- Implementation-specific character sets
- Unicode

## Concepts

- `characters`

## Prerequisites

- `integers`
- `conditionals`

## Resources to refer to

- [Common Lisp the Language](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/Groups/AI/html/cltl/clm/node137.html)

### Hints

- [Practical Common Lisp](http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/numbers-characters-and-strings.html)

### After

- [Unicode Support](https://www.cliki.net/Unicode%20support)
- [Unicode Library](http://edicl.github.io/cl-unicode/)

## Implementing

It's probably best to focus the exercise on what's standard, but it's
certainly worth pointing out the widespread Unicode support of modern
lisp implementations in the `after.md`
