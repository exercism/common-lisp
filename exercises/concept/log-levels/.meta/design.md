This exercise should teach some basics of working with strings.

## Learning Objectives

## Out of scope

- string formatting with `format`
- characters
- variations on trim (trim-left/trim-right)
- destructive variations
- string comparisons (`string<` _etc._)

## Concepts

- `strings`

## Prerequisites

- `conditionals`
- `symbols`
