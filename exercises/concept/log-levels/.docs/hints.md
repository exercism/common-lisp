## 1. Extract the message

- Implement `log-message` with `subseq`
- Strings are zero-indexed

## 2. Determine the severity

- Implement `log-severity` with a conditional expression using `string=`

## 3. Dealing with the vagaries of reality

- `string-equal` is a case-insensitive version of `string=`

## 4. Reformatting the log message according to log severity

- There are three functions mentioned in the introduction to do the transformations required.
