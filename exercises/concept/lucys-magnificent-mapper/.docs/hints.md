# Hints

## 1. Make magnificent

- Mapping is correct process to apply a function to every element of a sequence.
- `mapcar` is a good function to use to map a function across a list.

## 2. Only the best

- Filtering is the correct process to remove one or more items from a sequence, resulting in a new sequence.
- `remove` can remove values from a sequence which are equal to a specfic item.
- `remove-if` can remove values for which a predicate function evaluates to a true value.
