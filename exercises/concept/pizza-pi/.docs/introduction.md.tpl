# Introduction

In Common Lisp, like many languages, numbers come in a few of types â€“ two of the most basic are:

## Integers

%{concept:integers}

## Floating Point Numbers

%{concept:floating-point-numbers}

## Arithmetic

%{concept:arithmetic}

## Comparing Numbers

Finally, you may find it useful to compare different numbers using functions like `=` (equal), `/=` (not equal to), and `>=` (greater than or equal to).
When these comparisons are true (as in `(= 1 1)`), they return `T` and when they aren't (as in `(> 0 1)`), they return `NIL`.
