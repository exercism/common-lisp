# Hints

## General

- It might be useful to have a list of all of the numeric operations in Lisp.
– you can find a [full list here](http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/12_aa.htm)

## 1. A Dough Ratio

- Common Lisp has [a built-in constant](http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/v_pi.htm) for π (pi) 
- When it comes to rounding, the CL spec provides [a smattering of
  functions](http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_floorc.htm)

## 2. A Splash of Sauce

- There is [a built-in operator](http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_sqrt_.htm) that might help you take the square-root of a number

## 3. Some Cheese, Please

- For squaring or cubing numbers, there is a [built-in exponentiation function](http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_exp_e.htm)
- You might want to take a look at [this page of rounding   operations](http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_floorc.htm) and check out some of the alternatives to `round`.

## 4. A Fair Share

- This part requires using a function you may not have come across before, the [modulo
function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulo_operation) (`mod`). This function gives you the remainder of the division between two numbers.
- For comparing the result of `mod` to another number, [this page of comparison operators](http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_eq_sle.htm).
