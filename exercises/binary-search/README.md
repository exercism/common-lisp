# Binary Search

Implement a binary search algorithm.

Searching a sorted collection is a common task. A dictionary is a sorted
list of word definitions. Given a word, one can find its definition. A
telephone book is a sorted list of people's names, addresses, and
telephone numbers. Knowing someone's name allows one to quickly find
their telephone number and address.

If the list to be searched contains more than a few items (a dozen, say)
a binary search will require far fewer comparisons than a linear search,
but it imposes the requirement that the list be sorted.

In computer science, a binary search or half-interval search algorithm
finds the position of a specified input value (the search "key") within
an array sorted by key value.

In each step, the algorithm compares the search key value with the key
value of the middle element of the array.

If the keys match, then a matching element has been found and its index,
or position, is returned.

Otherwise, if the search key is less than the middle element's key, then
the algorithm repeats its action on the sub-array to the left of the
middle element or, if the search key is greater, on the sub-array to the
right.

If the remaining array to be searched is empty, then the key cannot be
found in the array and a special "not found" indication is returned.

A binary search halves the number of items to check with each iteration,
so locating an item (or determining its absence) takes logarithmic time.
A binary search is a dichotomic divide and conquer search algorithm.

## Note

Implement binary search yourself. Do not use built-in functions such
as `find`.

## Setup

Check out [Installing Common
Lisp](https://exercism.io/tracks/common-lisp/installation) for
instructions to get started or take a look at the guides available in
the [track's side bar](https://exercism.io/my/tracks/common-lisp).

## Formatting

While Common Lisp doesn't care about indentation and layout of code,
nor whether you use spaces or tabs, this is an important consideration
for submissions to exercism.io. Excercism.io's code widget cannot
handle mixing of tab and space characters well so using only spaces is recommended to make
the code more readable to the human reviewers. Please review your
editors settings on how to accomplish this. Below are instructions for
popular editors for Common Lisp.

### VIM

Use the following commands to ensure VIM uses only spaces for
indentation:

```vimscript
:set tabstop=2
:set shiftwidth=2
:set expandtab
```

(or as a oneliner `:set tabstop=2 shiftwidth=2 expandtab`). This can
be added to your `~/.vimrc` file to use it all the time.

### Emacs

Emacs is very well suited for editing Common Lisp and has many
powerful add-on packages available. The only thing that one needs to
do with a stock emacs to make it work well with exercism.io is to
evaluate the following code:

`(setq-default indent-tabs-mode nil)`

This can be placed in your `~/.emacs` (or `~/.emacs.d/init.el`) in
order to have it set whenever Emacs is launched.

One suggested add-on for Emacs and Common Lisp is
[SLIME](https://github.com/slime/slime) which offers tight integration
with the REPL; making iterative coding and testing very easy.
