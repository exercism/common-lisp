# Perfect Numbers

Determine if a number is perfect, abundant, or deficient based on
Nicomachus' (60 - 120 CE) classification scheme for natural numbers.

The Greek mathematician [Nicomachus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicomachus) devised a classification scheme for natural numbers, identifying each as belonging uniquely to the categories of **perfect**, **abundant**, or **deficient** based on their [aliquot sum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliquot_sum). The aliquot sum is defined as the sum of the factors of a number not including the number itself. For example, the aliquot sum of 15 is (1 + 3 + 5) = 9

- **Perfect**: aliquot sum = number
  - 6 is a perfect number because (1 + 2 + 3) = 6
  - 28 is a perfect number because (1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14) = 28
- **Abundant**: aliquot sum > number
  - 12 is an abundant number because (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6) = 16
  - 24 is an abundant number because (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 12) = 36
- **Deficient**: aliquot sum < number
  - 8 is a deficient number because (1 + 2 + 4) = 7
  - Prime numbers are deficient

Implement a way to determine whether a given number is **perfect**. Depending on your language track, you may also need to implement a way to determine whether a given number is **abundant** or **deficient**.

## Setup

Check out [Installing Common
Lisp](https://exercism.io/tracks/common-lisp/installation) for
instructions to get started or take a look at the guides available in
the [track's side bar](https://exercism.io/my/tracks/common-lisp).

## Formatting

While Common Lisp doesn't care about indentation and layout of code,
nor whether you use spaces or tabs, this is an important consideration
for submissions to exercism.io. Excercism.io's code widget cannot
handle mixing of tab and space characters well so using only spaces is recommended to make
the code more readable to the human reviewers. Please review your
editors settings on how to accomplish this. Below are instructions for
popular editors for Common Lisp.

### VIM

Use the following commands to ensure VIM uses only spaces for
indentation:

```vimscript
:set tabstop=2
:set shiftwidth=2
:set expandtab
```

(or as a oneliner `:set tabstop=2 shiftwidth=2 expandtab`). This can
be added to your `~/.vimrc` file to use it all the time.

### Emacs

Emacs is very well suited for editing Common Lisp and has many
powerful add-on packages available. The only thing that one needs to
do with a stock emacs to make it work well with exercism.io is to
evaluate the following code:

`(setq-default indent-tabs-mode nil)`

This can be placed in your `~/.emacs` (or `~/.emacs.d/init.el`) in
order to have it set whenever Emacs is launched.

One suggested add-on for Emacs and Common Lisp is
[SLIME](https://github.com/slime/slime) which offers tight integration
with the REPL; making iterative coding and testing very easy.
