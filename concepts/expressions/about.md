# About

Everything in Common Lisp is an expression. 
An expression is either a single thing (called an atom) or a list of things (delimited with parenthesis: `()`).

## Quoting

All S-Expressions, like symbols, can be quoted:

```lisp
;; This line is evaluated as code
(gimme-foo)  ; => FOO

;; This line is treated as data
'(gimme-foo) ; => (GIMME-FOO)
```

This quoting prevents the evaluation of an S-expression, instead treating it like data. 
Here is an excellent [Stack Overflow Answer][so-quoting] discussing quoting in a bit more detail.
