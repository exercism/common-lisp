# Resources

There are many more excellent resources, most of them cross linked in one of the learning section.

## Important resources

* [The Common Lisp HyperSpec][hyperspec],
  by X3J13 committee. The Common Lisp Standard
* [Common-Lisp.net][common-lisp-net], project hosting and
  gateway
* [The Common Lisp Wiki][cliki]

## Free books

There are many other great books you can find links to. These are the most popularly linked introductory works.

* [Practical Common Lisp][practical-common-lisp], by Peter
  Seibel
* [Land of Lisp][land-of-lisp], by Conrad Barski
* [Common Lisp: A Gentle Introduction to Symbolic Computation][common-lisp-gentle-introduction] (PDF), by David S. Touretzky
* [Common Lisp: An Interactive Approach][common-lisp-interactive] (PDF), by Stuart C. Shapiro
* [Successful Lisp: How to Understand and Use Common Lisp][successful-lisp], by David B. Lamkins

Following these are two more advanced books, but beginners shouldn't be afraid of them, they're quite accessible and "classics".

* [On Lisp][on-lisp], by Paul Graham
* [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs][sicp], by Abelson, Sussman, and Sussman

The last is actually on a related Lisp dialect, Scheme, but it's very helpful book, generally. 
If you find you prefer Scheme, it's an excellent start.
