# Installation

## What's needed

The basic items needed for developing in Common Lisp are:

- A Lisp "Implementation", which will allow you to compile and execute code, as well as supply a REPL.
- A Text editor with facilities for Lisp code. 
- (Nice to have) The often-used reference for the Common Lisp language, the ["Common Lisp Hyperspec"][hyperspec].

## Roswell

[Roswell][roswell] is a command to install and manage Common Lisp implementations, and many features to make developing and distrubuting Lisp applications easy.
We're using it to simplify the install and testing steps.

### Install Roswell

See the [Installation Guide][ros-inst] and follow the instructions for your platform.
For most users, the following will be sufficient:

* For MacOS and Linux, [Homebrew][brew] makes this simple:
  ```sh
  brew install roswell
  ```
* For Windows, use [Scoop][scoop]:
  ```powershell
  scoop install roswell
  ```

The first time you use Roswell, it will fetch and install SBCL and Quicklisp.
Just run this:
```sh
ros help
```

Enter the REPL with
```sh
ros run
```

## Configure your text editor

For people new to Common Lisp, particularly ones with previous experience with Emacs, can get an easy & quick start by installing [Portacle, the Portable Common Lisp Environment][portacle]. 
Free and full featured, it works in all common platforms and comes preconfigured "out of the box". This will supply:

- A Lisp implementation: SBCL, including Quicklisp and ASDF.
- A Text editor: Emacs

... with lots of add-ons for writing with Lisp code: 
- SLIME, the "Superior Lisp Interaction Mode for Emacs" turns Emacs into a Common Lisp IDE
- ParEdit, which makes working with parentheses easy. 

Everything comes already configured out of the box. Install Portacle by downloading from the [front page][portacle].

Note: Emacs (text editor) can be disorienting at first, if you're not accustomed to it. Fortunately there are many primers on Emacs and SLIME available online. 

## Traditional Start

If you prefer installing the needed tools separately you will need to install and set up:

- a Lisp-aware text editor: [Emacs][emacs] with the [Slime][slime] or [Sly][sly] package is a common choice but [VIM][vim] with [SLIMV][slimv], [Atom][atom] with [SLIMA][slima] or [VSCode][vscode] with a [Common Lisp plugin][vscode-plugin] are also good.
- a Common Lisp implementation: [SBCL][sbcl] is a "safe" choice which works across Linux, MacOS and Windows. Since the language is based upon a standard other [conforming implementations][awesome-cl-implementations] will work as well.
- [Quicklisp][quicklisp] for library management. After downloading it, follow the [instructions][quicklisp-install] to ensure it is properly integrated with your Common Lisp implementation.
