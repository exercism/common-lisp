# Learning

Exercism provides exercises and feedback but can be difficult to jump into for those learning Common Lisp for the first time. 
These resources can help you get started:

* [A Road to Common Lisp][road-to-cl], a blog post explaining one person's road to Common Lisp and their opinions on how to get started with it
* [Practical Common Lisp][practical-cl], a complete book for learning Common Lisp, available free online (as well as in print)
* [Common Lisp Cookbook][cl-cookbook]
* [Cliki.net Getting Start Started Page][cliki-getting-started]
* [Wikibooks book of Common Lisp, First steps][wikibooks-cl-first-steps]
  by various contributors
* [Awesome Common Lisp Learning][awesome-cl]
