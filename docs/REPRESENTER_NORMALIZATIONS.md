# Representer normalizations

The [representer][representer] uses [`read`][cl-read] to read the submission and [`write`][cl-write] to write the representation, as well as applying some additional normalizations.
Each submission has the following normalizations applied to it:

## Remove comments

Because [`read`][cl-read] is used to load the submission, comments are removed.

## Remove documentation strings

Instead of normalizing any names which may be present in the documentation string the string is removed. 
However the representation will note if a documentation string was present or not. 

## Normalize text case

Because [`read`][cl-read] is used to load the submission, all symbols are normalized to uppercase.

## Normalize text formatting

The representation is written with [`write`][cl-write] so any particulars of the submissions formatting (such as indentation, spacing, leaving closing parenthesis on empty lines) are not retained in the representation.

## Normalize symbol names

Symbols such as function, variable and macro names as well packages are mapped to [`gensyms`][cl-gensym] which are used in the representation.
